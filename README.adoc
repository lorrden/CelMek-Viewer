This is a simple viewer application for the
https://github.com/lorrden/swift-celmek[CelMek library].

Features planned, includes the following (ticks for the ones in a usable state):

- [x] Delta T plot
- [x] Conversions from Moslem / Islamic civil calendar
- [x] Conversions from Gregorian calendar
- [x] Conversions from Julian calendar
- [ ] Conversions from Jewish dates
- [x] Gregorian Day of Easter
- [x] Julian Day of Easter
- [ ] Jewish Day of Easter
- [x] Current date / time display
- [ ] Planetary orbital elements and positions
- [ ] Earth coordinate conversions
- [ ] Lunar positions

NOTE: Julian Dates are not supported in SwiftUI date pickers, so the we show a Gregorian calendar view instead.
However, this means that you will not see leap days when they are not in the Gregorian calendar.
